        <p id="archive1" class = "archive">I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe
            talent is just a
            pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.
            Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. We'll put some happy little leaves
            here and there. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Everyone
            wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let's do that again. I'm gonna
            start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue. The very fact that you're aware of
            suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. If you do too much it's
            going to lose its effectiveness. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
            In life you need colors. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We can fix anything. Automatically, all of
            these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. There we go. Look at them little rascals. </p>

        <h3>Horse Life</h3>
        <h4>lifestyle, animals, meaningful</h4>
        <h6>10/01/2020</h6>
        <p id="archive5" class = "archive"> I am a horse, and I wanted to share a few thoughts with all of you. As a horse, I live my life
            in the great outdoors, running freely, and enjoying the simple pleasures of grazing in lush pastures. But
            there are some things that I have observed that I think are important for humans to understand. First and
            foremost, please remember that we are living beings with feelings and emotions. So please treat us with
            kindness and respect. Secondly, please remember that we are not just tools to be used for your entertainment
            or work. We deserve to be treated with dignity and to have our needs met. Lastly, please remember that we
            are not invincible. We can get sick, tired, or injured just like you. So please take care of us, provide us
            with proper nutrition, shelter, and medical care, and give us the love and attention that we crave. I hope
            that these thoughts have given you a glimpse into the life of a horse. Let's strive to live in harmony and
            respect each other's differences.
